About the BlueBox
-----------------

The bluebox is a USB-powered ground station box design for the AAUSAT3 cubesat
satellite. The device firmware, control software and hardware is licensed under
the MIT license with the hope that it may be useful to other cubesat projects.

The device is built around the Analog Devices ADF7021 transceiver and controlled
by an Atmel ATMEGA32U4 microcontroller with hardware USB. The firmware makes use
of the open source LUFA USB stack and uses libusb and pyusb for communication
between the device and control program, bbctl.


How to install bbctl
--------------------

Using pip3:

    $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt --user

Note that you need gcc to compile the FEC extension module.

Make sure to add the pip localtion bin path to your PATH variable. For
example append:

    $ echo "export PATH=~/.local/bin:\$PATH" >> ~/.bashrc

Install the udev rules such that you don't need sudo to run bbtcl:

    $ sudo cp udev/* /etc/udev/rules.d/
    $ sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && sudo udevadm trigger
